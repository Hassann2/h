<strong>To build the circuit you will need those components:</strong>
<li>Arduino board (any board, if you don’t have Uno you can easily adapt by finding corresponding pins).</li>
<li>Breadboard.</li>
<li>LED – any color.</li>
<li>Push button.</li>
<li>220 Ohm resistor for the LED. If you don’t have this specific value, any resistor from 330 to 1k Ohm will do.</li>
<li>10k Ohm resistor for the push button. If you don’t have, you can go until 20k-50k Ohm.</li>
<li>A bunch of male to male wires (including if possible black, red, and other colors).</li>
